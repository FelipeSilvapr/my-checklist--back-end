# My Checklist — Back-end ✅

This is the my-checklist app's back-end. Since this is the very beggining of the project we do not have an MVP yet. But the project aims to be a collaborative tool where you can create, edit and get checklists for everything you need! No matter if you're going to the beach or making a study plan we intend to help you as well.

## running the project in your local enviroment

Make sure to have `Node` and `Npm` installed. Then open the terminal and go to the project's directory. There, follow the steps: 

 - `npm install`;
 - `echo "MONGOOSE_API_USER=\nMONGOOSE_API_PASSWORD=" > .env`;
 - Guess what? You need the credentials. [Talk with me](mailto:guilherme.lmoraes.devel@gmail.com);
 - Once you have it, put them on the `.env` file with following the syntax `KEY=value`;
 - `npm start`;

 And this should be enought! You're all good to go.
